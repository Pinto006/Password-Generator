# Password Generator WebPage

## Description

This website will now produce a secure password based on the criteria that the user would like to include.  The user must select a length between 8 and 128 characters.  It will now give the options to use lowerase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters in their password to make it more secure.  The password will generate in the window shown in the screenshot below after randomizing characters for them. I was able to build this by using Javascript, more spcificially, query selectors, functions, variables, a for loop and the math.floor and math.random methods.
